* Reference 
The following are the important *varaiable* to use. *Bit* does not allow us to create our own variable names. Instead we utilize a better approach which is using a predefined varaibles.
The following are the current vara=iable names and their use case.
 1. /compiler/: The compiler to use (e.g., g++, clang++)
 2. /flags/: Compiler flags to use
 3. /build_file/: Name of the output file
 4. /build_dir/: Name of the output file
 5. /source_file/: Source file to compile
 6. /build_type/: Type of build (executable or library)
Further more there will not be erros shown saying you misspell stuff or not it will crash since the commands are simple I do not this it will be needed to add all of the error checking but who know in the future that is the plan.
